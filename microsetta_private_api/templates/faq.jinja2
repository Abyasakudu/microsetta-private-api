                The Microsetta Initiative (TMI) is an extension of the American Gut and British Gut Projects with the
                specific aims of being globally inclusive and accommodating a broader range of host-associated sample
                types. The American Gut and British Gut Project both still operate through The Microsetta Initiative as
                regional projects, making TMI the central hub for providing kits to participants and hosting the
                participant website.

                In response to COVID-19, USPS deliveries have been reduced to our laboratory that runs from
                UC San Diego. We are working closely with UC San Diego Shipping and Logistics to ensure samples are
                delivered with minimal delay. All British Gut samples will be held at their site until they have
                resumed normal operations, and they are able to bulk ship samples back to us. Due to these delays,
                there may also be a longer waiting period for notifications regarding when your sample has been
                received by our lab.  Any samples we receive are placed in temperature-controlled freezers to ensure
                sample quality is maintained.
                <br>
                <br>
                If your sample has been sent via FedEx (new Microsetta kits), transit times from impacted areas might be
                increased, but sample quality won’t be affected.
